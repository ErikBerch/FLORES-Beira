    "# System Optimization - Damage Model\n",
    "This is the main system optimization (MODOS) - Damage Model. It is part of a research project at the TU Delft on developing a tool which can help decision making early on in the design process. It uses the limited data availabe during conceptual design to show how design choices affect an area vulnerable to flooding and helps to optimize the system of flood risk reduction measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Setup\n",
    "The system optimization works by combining two models: The Optimization Model and the Damage Model. The Damage Model (this file) simulates the impact of a given storm on a vulnerable region. Also, it is possible to simulate the change of impact due to the implementation of a Flood Risk Reduction Stategy. This strategy can consist of a number of different flood risk reduction measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Optimization Model is able to run the Damage Model numerous times, with different storms and different Flood Risk Reduction Strategies an analyze the outcome. With this data, it is possible to learn and predict how the region would react to particular design choices and show how the impact of one measure would change by changing the rest of the system. The Optimization Model is not included in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Damage Model\n",
    "The core of the system optimzation is the Damage Model, which is primarily run from this script. It models the vulnerable region as a sequence of Protective Layers and Protected Areas. Here, the protective layers can (but do not have to) consist of flood defense structures, like levees or storm surge barrier. These can be placed on land, as well as in water. The protected areas are defined as areas where flood protective is not the primary land use. This is where the people live and work and will  therefore account for most of the damage. The damage follows from a calculation of the water levels in different parts of the region. \n",
    "\n",
    "The water levels, wave heights, failure probabilities and anything related to these variables are based on simplified hydraulic formulas. The boundary conditions at sea are based on externally run (ADCIRC) models. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Damage Model follows the path of the flood, as it starts at sea and runs toward the coast and further inland. The strength of the model is its ability to include multiple layers of defense. Also, it is possible to include a wide variety of flood risk reduction measures, from structural flood defenses to Nature-based Solutions or Spatial planning policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use the Damage Model\n",
    "Many functions in this model are based on definitions and calculations from other files. These files should be included in a folder \"Library\", which should be located in the same folder as the model itself. the required files are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - DamageModelCalculations.py \n",
    " - DamageModelDefinitions.py\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is still under construction. If you make any changes, please note the latest changes.\n",
